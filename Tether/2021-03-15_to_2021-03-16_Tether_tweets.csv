1371402029810266112,2021-03-15 10:04:57,0,421,34,@Black_Japanther Sorry for late reply! People say USDT (tether) is being used to manipulate the price of bitcoin. Coinbase dosnt use tether but foreign exchanges like binance do. So when the price of bitcoin goes up and the coinbase spread premium is negative it suggests a tether pump from asia.
