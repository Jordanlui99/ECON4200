Well i mean it's either this or tether and why WOULDN'T I use tether? It's like comparing the first 3 wisp abilities to the 4. is the 4 good? Sure but in comparison?
1375629619915677696,2021-03-27 02:03:54,0,911,528,@AcolyteSynpai and everything to do with the fact you didn't need any other avionic beside tether to be effective. That's just my experience though. I got more use out of the Tactical side than any other. Like I could VH into a MV or SV or i could just Tether which was 1 ability and cheaper
1375629327165845504,2021-03-27 02:02:44,0,911,528,@AcolyteSynpai i ran tether and seeker volley. I personally found SV good to a point and then just fell off by Veil. Not that it was bad but again Tether was just super boom no matter what. Same with BOP which i actually still don't see a use for. For me it had little to do with capacity
