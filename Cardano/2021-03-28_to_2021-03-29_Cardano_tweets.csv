1376084820896387073,2021-03-28 08:12:42,0,1156,734,"9/12 Eventually it does not matter which pool you choose: it's the protocol that determines the rewards, not the pool. The protocol determines that avg rewards are around 5,5% so pls choose to help a small pool. In the end it is of no difference to you. #Cardano #helpsmallpools"
1376084819331985409,2021-03-28 08:12:42,0,1156,734,8/12 Choosing a small pool ensures that the network gets more #decentralized. The more ppl are choosing the same popular pool the more centralized it gets. This is why pools get saturated: to motivate ppl to choose another pool. #Cardano #helpsmallpools

1376084812218437635,2021-03-28 08:12:40,1,1156,734,4/12 They use these fees to pay the high staking rewards they offer so you are actually paying for your own rewards while making it possible for binance to lure even more ppl because they 'offer' (but not really!) these high rewards. #Cardano #helpsmallpools
1376084810368749574,2021-03-28 08:12:39,1,1156,734,3/12 They 'offer' locked staking because they exactly know how much return and profit they make during this period. They charge a higher amount of fixed fee and a margin fee that goes up to 6x as high as normal. #Cardano #helpsmallpools https://t.co/hRxllLfVU0

Because your money is on their exchange, in their wallet, they own the private keys to your tokens. This gives them power to do whatever they want. #Cardano #helpsmallpools"
